# RPGLootFeed

RPGLootFeed is a World of Warcraft addon designed to elevate your looting experience by offering a dynamic and immersive loot feed, reminiscent of what you'd find in popular open-world RPGs.

With RPGLootFeed, all your looted items and currencies are displayed in a sleek, scrolling feed that keeps you informed without cluttering your screen. Whether you're raiding, questing, or farming, RPGLootFeed ensures that you never miss a drop.
